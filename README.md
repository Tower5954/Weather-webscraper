# Weather-webscraper

Newcastle (easily adapted to other locations) weather webscraper taken from the BBC webpage.
I built this to see about creating a database to track the weather (using the weather because it will change constantly) and create data to show the changes probably with a line graph perhaps and/or a daily variance cell?
